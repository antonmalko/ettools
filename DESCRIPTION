Maintainer: Anton Malko <amalko@umd.edu>
Description: The package contains utility function for dealing with
  eye-tracking data (reading studies only). The package is assuming the output
  produced by the eye-tracking scripts from UMD ("EyePy"). In principle, it
  should be flexible enough to work with any similarly organized data, but has
  not been tested with any other scripts explicitly.
